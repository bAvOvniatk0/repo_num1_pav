Subtask 1:  Why did I choose to participate in the Dare IT Challenge?
Hi all! My name is Pavlo. I'm glad having this opportunity to participate in Dare IT course and challenge the tasks being given here. I'm curious and anger to find, create and improve more practical skills in IT and to look forward for my future. Let's the story begin!
Wish everyone and myself luck!
Kind regards, Pavlo D
